# TODO(08): RE-TUNE THESE — they are calibrated for an electron+muon event and
# are wrong now that photon is summed in. The distributions quoted below were
# measured on a two-component corpus; the photon component carries roughly twice
# the electron's points (measured 185,388 vs 94,059 over 23 events), so per-
# detector counts rise substantially and both the "saw a particle" floor and the
# detector-count midpoint sit in the wrong place. Concretely:
#   - a DARK detector is still dark, so LAYOUT_THRESHOLD = 1.0 keeps its meaning,
#     but a LIT one clears it far more easily, pushing the soft trigger count up
#     and re-flattening `r` toward 1.0 — the exact failure the 5e-2 -> 1.0 change
#     below was made to fix, arriving from the other direction
#   - RECONSTRUCT_THRESHOLD = 10.0 is a physical minimum, but TAU_RECONSTRUCT
#     was chosen so the transition spans the *observed* spread of n; a shifted
#     distribution narrows the fraction of events in the transition and drains
