# serial_requeue preempts jobs without warning. --requeue puts the job straight
# back in the queue instead of killing it, and the julia script resumes from its
# last completed chunk, so preemption costs one chunk rather than the whole run.
#SBATCH --requeue

# nu_tau injection -> tau propagation -> geometric cuts -> HDF5.
# Drives decay_locations/tau_wholesky.jl.
#
# Usage:
#   sbatch run_tau_wholesky_batch.sh 100             # smoke test (run this first)
#   sbatch run_tau_wholesky_batch.sh 200000          # production corpus
#   NEVENT=100 ./run_tau_wholesky_batch.sh           # run outside slurm
#
# The run is checkpointed per chunk (see CHUNK below). To resume after a time
# limit or a preemption, just resubmit the SAME script unchanged -- completed
# chunks are skipped. Do not change NEVENT/SEED/CHUNK between resumes or the
# shard directory changes name and the run starts over.
#
# The first job also builds the julia depot (~200 pkgs, incl. C++/Fortran deps),
# which dominates its wall time. Later jobs reuse ~/.julia and skip straight to
# the run -- so do the 100-event smoke test first and let it warm the cache.
#
# No GPU: this is a CPU job (TauRunner + PROPOSAL). Do not request --gres=gpu.

# Julia is NOT provided by the module system on this cluster (the only module is
# julia/1.0.0-ncf, which is from 2018 and does not even load). Per
# https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/julia/ you install it yourself with juliaup:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh     # on a compute node
#   source ~/.bashrc
#
# TAMBOSIM_PATH is the TamboSim repo root (contains resources/ and Project.toml).
# The julia script activates that project itself and reads it from the env, so it
# is exported rather than passed as a flag.

# explicitly says to install/build packages from a compute node for this reason.
