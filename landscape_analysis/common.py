"""Shared setup for the landscape analyses.

Every script here needs the same four things: the frozen surrogate pair, the
mountain, a set of fresh primary batches, and a way to score a layout. Each one
used to carry its own copy of that, around forty lines apiece. This is that copy,
written once.

Importing this module selects the non-interactive matplotlib backend, because
every script here writes PNGs from a batch job and none of them opens a window.
