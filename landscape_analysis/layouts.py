"""Where these analyses read their inputs from and write their results to.

Every script here used to name an absolute path to a layout produced by a
particular stage-4 run. Those paths pinned the analyses to layouts optimized
against an older mountain, so re-running after the geometry changed would have
snapped stale coordinates onto the new mesh and reported the result as current.

Layouts are therefore named here, once. Override the base directory with
$TAMBO_LAYOUT_BASE; individual scripts that take a --layout argument still win
over both.
