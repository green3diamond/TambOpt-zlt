"""Shared pieces for the evaluators here.

`true_utility` is the scoring module every evaluator compares against. It lives
in the plots tree, whose layout is not the same in every checkout, so the search
happens once here instead of five scripts each naming a path.

`_corpus_paths` and `build_primaries` live here rather than in that module
because they are specific to evaluating a corpus other than the training one.
`primary.pt` is row-aligned to the corpus Step 1 consumed, so slicing its first B
rows for a different corpus pairs clouds with the wrong events' ground truth,
which is worse than leakage. These rebuild the encoding from corpus metadata plus
the decay-position sidecar instead.
