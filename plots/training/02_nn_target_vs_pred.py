"""Target vs prediction scatter for the trained FNN and recon nets.

Loads the cached corpus and the frozen checkpoints, evaluates each on its
shower-level validation split, and plots target vs prediction against a 1:1 line.
The recon runs on FNN-predicted (E, T) rather than ground truth, so its scatter
shows end-to-end FNN -> recon error.

    python plots/training/02_nn_target_vs_pred.py
    python plots/training/02_nn_target_vs_pred.py --dual   # dual-species surrogate

In --dual mode the FNN scatter is rendered PER SPECIES — each per-species DeepSets
model against its own species-filtered subset (split on the Step-1 species_ids
sidecar), since the corpus E/T ground truth is per-species. The recon scatter uses
the combined DualSpeciesSurrogate on the full corpus, as Step 3 does. Outputs:

    FNN_FOLDER/fnn_<species>_target_vs_pred.png
    FNN_FOLDER/fnn_<species>_conditional.png    P(pred | target), hit-only
    FNN_FOLDER/fnn_<species>_calibration.png    predicted sigma vs realised error
    RECON_FOLDER_deepsets/recon_target_vs_pred.png
    RECON_FOLDER_deepsets/recon_conditional.png

**Read `*_conditional.png` for surrogate quality.** The joint hexbin in
`*_target_vs_pred.png` is dominated by the dark-detector population (target = 0)
and by the mean head being fitted to a stochastic target, so it understates the
model; the conditional figure drops dark samples, normalises per target-column,
and shows the compression as a slope.

Recon folder: Step 3 writes to RECON_FOLDER + "_deepsets", so that is where
--dual reads recon.pt and writes its scatter.

    densely-populated target (e.g. the recon's continuous primary channels),
    where every sample is a regression sample and none should be dropped.

    None, the window is `[0, p99.9(target)]`, the FNN's original default.

    DO NOT READ THE SLOPE AGAINST 1.00. This direction conditions on a noisy
    realisation of the target while the net is fitted to `E[y | input]`, so
    regression attenuation holds the slope below 1 however good the model is;
    calling the gap to 1.00 "compression" over-accuses the model.

    The reference it IS read against is measured, never claimed. Writing

        expected slope = Var(pred) / Var(target)
        bias ratio     = Cov(pred, target) / Var(pred)     (ideal 1.00)

    both from measured moments alone.

    MEAN, not median: the mean is what the Gaussian NLL fits the head to, and
    the conditional is strongly right-skewed in log1p space near zero.

    Only the slope and its expected value reach the title; the rest goes to
